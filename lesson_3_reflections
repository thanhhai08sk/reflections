When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your works local?
When I want to work with other persons or save it online.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When I and other work on same branch, it will make me confuse.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks make clone only on Github. clones can make a copy repository from githup to my computer or from a local location to another local location. Branchs when I want to make a new version of codes.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can colaborate with other people by github
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I never collaborate code before.
