How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Because I'll see changes, that changes may cause bug.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Cause I can go back any time I make bug.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: each commit has logical meaning.
Cons: may be I'll forget to make a commit.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs we make changes one files but nomaly doesn't relative to other file.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log in the directory of git files, use git diff to se the different between two commit ID.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I can go back any time, I can find bug by git diff too.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
